# Academic Success and Dropout Rate Analysis 

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the success and dropout rates of students from higher education institutions across Europe in the year 2021. By leveraging data on academic paths, demographics, and socio-economic factors, our team seeks to identify students at risk of dropping out early to enable targeted interventions and support.

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of information about students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees. It includes details such as demographics, academic performance in the first and second semesters, and socio-economic factors.

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)
- **Rows:** 4424
- **Columns:** 36
- **Scope:** Students from European countries in 2021

## Features

- **Data Profiling:** Univariate and multivariate analyses provide insights into academic grades, age distributions, and economic factors like unemployment and inflation rates.
- **Visualizations:** Multiple charts and graphs illustrate correlations between academic performance, socio-economic status, marital status, and dropout rates.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to predict dropout risks based on various features.

## Key Visualizations

1. **Admission Grades and Enrollment Age:** Examines the correlation between higher admission grades and a greater likelihood of graduation.
2. **Marital Status Analysis:** Reveals how marital status impacts dropout rates, with married students showing higher dropout rates.
3. **Debt and Financial Aid Analysis:** Discusses the influence of financial stability on student success.

## Predictive Model

- **Tool:** Google Colab
- **Model:** Random Forest
- **Accuracy:** 70.56%
- **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, precision, recall

## Dashboard

A comprehensive Tableau dashboard is available to explore the dataset visually.
